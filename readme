=== README of HotBatch by sandaasu ===

- batchkeyer.cfg file is required for HotBatch to work. 
Make sure there is this file next to the HotBatch.exe

- the batchkeyer.cfg file have to be configured !
Use this DEFAULT cfg file content if you dont have one :

[HOTKEYS]
hotkey01=VK_NUMPAD1
hotkey02=VK_NUMPAD2
hotkey03=VK_NUMPAD3
hotkey04=VK_NUMPAD4
hotkey05=VK_NUMPAD5
hotkey06=VK_NUMPAD6
hotkey07=VK_NUMPAD7
hotkey08=VK_NUMPAD8
hotkey09=VK_NUMPAD9
[SETTINGS]
debugmode=false
logging=false

- The hotkeys can be used everywhere once the program is running.

- you can run the bat scripts without getting disturbed by a 
opening CMD window so I used to embedd the scripts into HotBatch.
Their output log can be viewed inside the HotBatch window.

-- EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE --
Note that this is not a finished product yet, i am still working on 
it and making improvements .
